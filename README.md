Cantor
======

Builds Cantor Sets from a given input

To use: build and run the program. Enter in the order and the program will output the final line. 

What is a Cantor set. Simply its a line split into thirds with the middle third removed. In my implementation - is the smallest line segment. To read more about Cantor sets (which are pretty cool): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set

Things I want to add:
  A button which will show each step of the derivation ie: 
  "---------" 
  "---    ---" 
  "- -    - -"
